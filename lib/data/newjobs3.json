With a commitment to solving billing and patient experience issues, Cedar has become a leading healthcare technology company fueled by remarkable growth. Over the past several years, weve raised more than $350 million in funding from investors such as Andreessen Horowitz and Tiger Global, bringing Cedars valuation to $3.2 billion.\n\nAs of December 2022, Cedar is engaging with 20 million patients on an annualized basis, and is on target to process $2.7 billion in patient payments annually. Cedars ambition is to serve 50-60 million Americans by 2025, about half of the U.S. population that makes medical payments annually. Cedar partners with more than 55 leading healthcare providers and payers including Highmark Inc., Allegheny Health Network, Summit Health, Novant Health, Allina Health and Providence",

At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft...\n\nWe've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do.

    "description": "ROLE OVERVIEW\n\nThe Domain Graph & APIs team builds the platform and tooling for Benchling’s internal Domain Modeling system and generated APIs. It also owns our OpenAPI spec driven public REST API service. Benchling’s customers model their science on Benchling, and the Domain Graph is a ubiquitous modeling language based on GraphQL SDL to map the language of science to the types and data models... that form the basis of a consistent platform and product semantics and experience. The team is building and evolving Benchling’s core development stack to be Domain Driven and API first. They partner with other platform and product teams to ensure modeling consistency and best practices, as well as defining interfaces to adjacent systems that persist data and generate change events. As an engineer on the Domain Graph team, you'll work with many teams in product and platform, and your work will be key to several company-level goals.\n\nRESPONSIBILITIES\n• Own projects end-to-end, from initial design, to prototype, to large-scale rollout.\n• Design and implement rich backend type systems, components and architecture.\n• Design and implement backend models and API endpoints for complex scientific workflows.\n• Work closely with product managers, and other engineering teams to ensure the domain modeling best practices and coverage.\n• Help rapidly scale our product and team. As a member of the engineering team, you'll be an integral part of how we mature our tooling, best practices, engineering processes, and hiring.\n\nCheck out our engineering blog for some examples of past work. Here are some other examples of recent and future projects:\n• Tools to simulate DNA assembly - computers can assist scientists by informing scientific decisions with complex calculations. Our bulk assembly tool allows scientists to simulate constructing hundreds of DNA constructs in parallel, visualizing the end result and highlighting potential issues.\n• Chemistry tools - we have focused primarily on biology and biotech for the last 5 years, but are just starting new initiatives to expand our tools to support chemists as well. This will involve modeling complex chemical reactions within Benchling, and is an opportunity to see a new product grow from the ground up.\n• Robot and machine integration - scientists are increasingly using automated hardware in the lab to perform measurements. By integrating Benchling with machines like liquid handlers, we are working towards a world where a scientist can perform a physical experiment entirely using software.\n\nQUALIFICATIONS\n• Have 1-3 years of experience in software engineering.\n• Have strong abilities in problem solving and iterating on feedback.\n• Enjoy ownership and building key pieces of product and platform jointly.\n• Are interested in learning more about life science (prior knowledge is not required; desire to learn is a must).\n• Willing to work onsite in our Boston office 3 days a week.\n\nSALARY RANGE\n\nBenchling takes a market-based approach to pay. The candidate's starting pay will be determined based on job-related skills, experience, qualifications, interview performance, and work location.\n\nFor this role the base salary range is $134,385-$181,815\n\nTo help you determine which zone applies to your location, please see this resource. If you have questions regarding a specific location's zone designation, please contact a recruiter for additional information.\n\nTotal Compensation includes the following:\n• Competitive salary and equity\n• 100% premiums covered for health, dental, and vision for employees\n• Fertility healthcare and family-forming benefits\n• Four months of fully paid parental leave\n• 401(k) + Employer Match\n• Commuter benefits\n• Home office stipend\n• Mental health benefits + Wellness stipend\n• Learning and development stipend\n• Generous PTO\n• Company-wide Summer & Winter holiday shutdown\n• Sabbaticals for 5-year and 10-year anniversaries\n\n#BI-Hybrid\n\n#LI-EN1",
