    "description": "About Us:\n\nWe're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft...\n\nWe've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.\n\nNotion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).\nAbout The Role:\n\nMillions of people use Notion, and tens of thousands of developers are making Notion more powerful for those users (and themselves) by building features, power-ups, and novel new tools on top of Notion's developer interface.\n\nWe are focusing on extending our API for strategic partnerships and use cases. We need your help to make existing APIs more robust & reliable, while architecting new classes of APIs to cultivate a rich ecosystem of tooling built on top of Notion. You will design and build powerful, scalable, and developer-friendly sets of APIs, enabling partner and customer developers to extend Notion to be even more useful as a connected workspace for the millions of users and teams who rely on us every day.\nWhat You'll Achieve:\n• You'll help architect new classes of APIs that can be composed together by partner and customer developers to solve users' needs.\n• You'll understand the developer use cases and work to ensure that they are all well supported in the APIs you design and implement.\n• You'll improve the usability, performance, reliability and architecture of our externally facing developer APIs service and system.\nSkills You'll Need to Bring:\n• Experienced engineer & mentor: You have 8+ years of experience as a software engineer building scalable technology. You're excited about bringing your pre-existing knowledge and experience to the team. You have experience working with and mentoring other software engineers.\n• Pragmatic and business-oriented: You care about business impact and prioritize projects accordingly. You're not just going after cool stuff-you understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line.\n• External developer API expertise: You have experience building interfaces or tools for external developers to use, or you're motivated and excited to learn best practices in this domain.\n• Thoughtful problem-solving: For you, problem-solving starts with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You can decompose tricky problems and work towards a clean solution, by yourself or with teammates.

    "description": "TITLE: Software Engineer II\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT – BIOINFORMATICS AND SOFTWARE ENGINEERING\n...\nWe are seeking talented, curious, and self-motivated software engineers to help build the most advanced production-scale synthetic biology platform on the planet. Client X manufactures sustainable plant-derived ingredients using fermentation-based technology to help accelerate the move away from petrochemicals in our food, cosmetics and medicines. Our ingredients are used by more than 250 million consumers in over 2,000 of the worlds’ leading brands.\n\nR&D at Client X is a highly multidisciplinary effort and the Bioinformatics, Automation and Software Engineering (BASE) group is at its core driving us forward. Every aspect of our work, from modifying the DNA of microorganisms in the lab to full scale factory production, is facilitated by software and hardware automation. In addition, we collaborate daily with data scientists and computational biologists to use our wealth of data to solve problems using machine learning and other optimization techniques. Our tools integrate the activities of scientists, engineers, and industrial robots to enable the rapid optimization of genetic designs and laboratory processes to deliver high quality ingredients to our customers.\n\nAmong the tools we have developed are a CAD/CAM system for genetic engineering: a compiler toolchain whose target architecture is life itself. This stack physically integrates high level genetic modules into microbial hosts. We also derive novel strains through random mutagenesis and directed evolution. Using our custom control platform, we then subject these experimental organisms to high throughput performance screening in our state-of-the-art robotic labs.\nResponsibilities:\n• Design, develop and maintain web-based application written in Python.\n• Collaborate with scientists to transform an understanding of their workflow into designs and implementations of appropriate data models and user interfaces.\n• Effectively communicate with research scientists.\n• Apply best practices of software development throughout your work, while staying abreast of advances in the practice.\n\nQualifications:\n• 3+ years of professional programming experience\n• Strong coding skills in either Python or a similar language. Ideally deep experience in multiple languages. In addition to Python, Amyris has codebases in F#, R and PHP (phasing out, but still have some important legacy code).\n• Experience with full-stack web application development, including coding skills in JavaScript, CSS and HTML. Relational database design and coding experience. We use PostgreSQL and SQL Server, though we also treat plasmids and chromosomes as datastores.\n• Experience developing software in a Unix environment. Dev tools are chosen at the developer’s discretion, but most of the software development and all production deployment is on Linux (Ubuntu).\n• Fluent Linux command-line skills.\n• Interest and ability to communicate with scientists",

These positions will also assume more of a strategic and less of a tactical perspective with respect to Department planning efforts. They will exhibit a proven record of accomplishment showing project management skills and/or successfully completed projects in which they participated in a leadership role, and a thorough understanding of the various roles of project team members. They will also have demonstrated a high degree of participation in the mentoring and development of other IT Services staff.

    "description": "Summary Posted: May 8, 2023\nWeekly Hours: 40\nRole Number:200477216...\n\nOur mission is to personalize the user experience on Apple devices based on where you go, when, and what those places mean to you. You’re experiencing our work whenever you see a suggested location in Maps or Calendar, or browse your Memories in Photos. We’re working for you whenever your phone engages Do Not Disturb While Driving or remembers where you parked. We’re looking for motivated, experienced technical leaders to help take our software to the next level of capability, quality, and impact. Do you have a background in GPS, WiFi location, or embedded sensing, and are looking to move up the stack? Do you know recommendation engines, and want to apply that experience to a deeply impactful and broadly applicable domain? Are you excited by the optimization problem of providing rich contextual intelligence within a constrained resource footprint? If any of these describe you, read on.\nKey Qualifications\n• Real passion for the location domain. We believe that mobility is transformative, and that to realize that transformation, your devices need to understand the places you go and what they mean to you. That’s what we do. If you have experience in location estimation—GPS/GNSS, WiFi positioning, indoor localization, or discrete localization—we're especially eager to speak with you.\n• 5+ years experience developing commercial software. Most of the code you write will run on mobile devices, in the hands of hundreds of millions of Apple customers. We use Objective-C, but if you know C, modern C++, or Swift, you shouldn’t have a problem.\n• A working knowledge of statistics fundamentals. Your code will make estimates, identify patterns, and quantify how strong they are. You should be comfortable using histograms, basic probability, and Bayes’s Theorem. If you have a background in signal processing, data science, or machine learning, that's even better.\n• An ability to evaluate and optimize for system performance: memory, CPU, radios, etc. Our software needs to provide a high level of service while sipping power. We think this is a really exciting challenge. If it sounds frustrating to you, this isn’t the right position.\n• A proven track record working effectively across teams. One of the cool things about Apple is how much you will work with people who have different expertise and responsibilities than you: apps, sensors, connectivity, and others. You’ll need to communicate clearly, plan collaboratively, execute flexibly, and cope with what will sometimes feel like a high degree of uncertainty.\n• Experience processing real-world data at scale, server-side. Not every candidate will have experience with Spark, Hadoop, or NoSQL data stores, but the best ones will.\n\nDescription\nIn this job, you’ll develop the next frontier of mobile technology, in partnership with teams in sensing, Siri, and apps. Hungry for the responsibility to work on complex problems from end to end? In this position, you will: - Conceptualize, explore, and define new inferential and predictive location- and motion-based capabilities for Apple's platforms. - Collect, curate, and analyze real-world data sets of varying size and complexity. - Aggregate, filter, and cluster data on mobile devices, from a variety of local sensors: GPS, WiFi, accelerometer, and others. - Design and implement algorithms, then integrate them into production code. - Test your work. Dog-food it. Collect metrics, and iterate. Don’t forget to sweat the edge cases—an issue that impacts 1% of a billion devices is a big issue. A dedication to users’ privacy and security is core to how Apple does business. We want their devices to exhibit the high level of intelligence and proactivity that can only come from deep contextual understanding. We don’t want their sensitive data coming back to Apple or being exposed to third parties. Other companies solve similar problems in very different ways. Our way is more work. We believe it’s worth it.\n\nEducation & Experience\nBS, MS, or PhD in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, or a similar field\n\nAdditional Requirements\n\nPay & Benefits\n• At Apple, base pay is one part of our total compensation package and is determined within a range. This provides the opportunity to progress as you grow and develop within a role. The base pay range for this role is between $138,900 and $256,500, and your base pay will depend on your skills, qualifications, experience, and location.\n\nApple employees also have the opportunity to become an Apple shareholder through participation in Apple’s discretionary employee stock programs. Apple employees are eligible for discretionary restricted stock unit awards, and can purchase Apple stock at a discount if voluntarily participating in Apple’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan. You’ll also receive benefits including: Comprehensive medical and dental coverage, retirement benefits, a range of discounted products and free services, and for formal education related to advancing your career at Apple, reimbursement for certain educational expenses — including tuition. Additionally, this role might be eligible for discretionary bonuses or commission payments as well as relocation.
