At Triumph, you will join an engineering driven culture that thrives on deep technical expertise, is output oriented, and is deeply non-bureaucratic. We have a radically high bar, but for the right individual, this is an opportunity like no other. Expect to learn more here within a year than at any company you've worked at before.

Strong opinions on matters technical that will help drive the direction of the company. An unwavering bias for action, building, and refining A passion for IC work - you should have been a builder at most/all previous roles, and love the idea of being an IC at a company that is built around supporting 10xers. A strong signal on this is being a vim wizard, having comfort with Linux, and having strong CS principles. Capability to self direct Tech stack we use (nice to have experience): Unity, Swift, Google Cloud (Firestore/Cloud Run), Python *What You Get * The chance to collaborate with like-minded, high-performing co-workers.

We are building an AI pair programmer that feels like a full colleague inside your computer - capable, conversational, and reliable across domains. If this isn't AGI, then what is? Join us if you want to build and safely deploy aligned AGI in products that matter. As a Senior Software Engineer, you'll work on frontend, backend, or infrastructure to make our models accessible and useful to developers around the world. We're looking for 5y+ experience as a software developer High-energy: you love what you do Ambition: you want to make something great Magic's culture Integrity. Words and actions should be aligned. Hands-on. Most of us have previously led engineering teams. At Magic, there are no managers. We all spend the vast majority of our time on engineering. If you want to solve hard problems, Magic is the right place for you. Teamwork. We move as one team, not N individuals. Focus. Ethically deploy AGI. Everything else is noise. Quality. We have high standards for ourselves and our products. Magic should feel like magic. Benefits and perks Benchmark-based compensation in the 75th or 90th percentile, including base salary, equity, and benefits Flexible working hours In-person (London, SF, NYC, or Vienna) or remote A small, fast-paced, highly focused team About Magic Magic is a public benefit corporation dedicated to building and safely deploying aligned, superhuman AGI. FAQ: What's your motivation? Automation has led humanity from subsistence farming to becoming a globally connected society. AGI is the ultimate chapter of the story of human tool-building, presenting the potential to decouple productivity and ingenuity from human labor. What if the last 50 years of technological progress happened in 2 days? We want to make this a possibility. Funding? We've raised $28M from tier 1 investors. How do we balance deploying the technology today with ambitions for AGI? We think deploying AI within the right interfaces is just as important as the technology itself. Building an AI pair programmer helps us do both at the same time. We aim to launch gradually improving AI assistants while pursuing work on what will ultimately become AGI. Do you train your own models? Yes Do you care about the product? It's funny that this is an FAQ, but many AI companies neglect UX and focus only on their model. Yes, we care. Can I work from anywhere? We welcome applications from anyone around the world. We'll look at visa requirements case by case. I don't meet all the criteria, should I still apply? If you feel you have something to contribute to the mission and you're a high-energy person, absolutely. We make exceptions for exceptional people.",

This includes DNA editing tools, an electronic lab notebook, sample tracking, workflow design, and more. RESPONSIBILITIES Own projects end-to-end, from initial design, to prototype, to large-scale rollout. Design and implement backend models and API endpoints for complex scientific workflows. Design and implement rich frontend components and architecture. We build and operate one of the largest, richest React applications out there and power complex scientific analyses. Work closely with product managers, designers, marketing, and sales to ensure the right context is being shared. Help rapidly scale our product and team. As a member of the engineering team, you'll be an integral part of how we mature our tooling, best practices, engineering processes, and hiring. Check out our engineering blog for some examples of past work. Here are some other examples of recent and future projects: Tools to simulate DNA assembly - computers can assist scientists by informing scientific decisions with complex calculations. Our bulk assembly tool allows scientists to simulate constructing hundreds of DNA constructs in parallel, visualizing the end result and highlighting potential issues. Chemistry tools - we have focused primarily on biology and biotech for the last 5 years, but are just starting new initiatives to expand our tools to support chemists as well. This will involve modeling complex chemical reactions within Benchling, and is a opportunity to see a new product grow from the ground up. Robot and machine integration - scientists are increasingly using automated hardware in the lab to perform measurements. By integrating Benchling with machines like liquid handlers, we are working towards a world where a scientist can perform a physical experiment entirely using software. QUALIFICATIONS Have 3-5 years of experience in software engineering. Build software with a product-first approach. You ship code quickly and care about the real world impact of your code. Have strong abilities in problem solving and iterating on feedback. Enjoy ownership and building key pieces of product. Are interested in learning more about life science (prior knowledge is not required; desire to learn is a must). SALARY RANGE Benchling takes a market-based approach to pay. The candidate's starting pay will be determined based on job-related skills, experience, qualifications, interview performance, and work location. For this role the base salary range is: ZONE 1: 157,250 - 212,750 To help you determine which zone applies to your location, please see this resource. If you have questions regarding a specific location's zone designation, please contact a recruiter for additional information.

But the way that companies hire hasn‚Äôt changed in decades, and recruiting as a core business function has been largely left behind by technology innovations in other functions like sales, customer success, marketing, etc. Job descriptions are still written in silo-ed documents, recruiting metrics end at time-to-fill instead of quality-of-hire, and we have a devastating diversity problem. While these are big challenges, we see a huge opportunity for Searchlight to own a ton of whitespace in the recruiting tech landscape.
