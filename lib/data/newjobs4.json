    "description": "mission\n\nWe believe that the current social care landscape in the UK is deeply broken. Equal Care's mission is to put power back where it belongs: in the hands of the people who give and receive care. We help people giving and receiving care to develop meaningful relationships through our unique, decentralised structure. We are a pioneer in the platform co-operative movement and lean heavily on technical innovation, making it possible to cut out tiers of managers and give that money to the people who do the direct support: our wonderful care and support workers.\n\nIn 2022, we doubled the number of hours of care we delivered, whilst maintaining our exceptional turnover rate of 4% (compared to an industry average of 39%). Over the next year, we're learning how to grow the decentralised model with a view to expand outside of Calderdale.\n\nthe role at a glance\n\nBy working closely with people from all over the co-op, you'll learn what makes our model so special and what's holding it back... Your job will be to find solutions to those problems. It's an extremely varied role, and that's exactly what we find exciting about it.\n\nlocation\n\nThis position is open to anyone with the right to work in the UK. The vast majority of work is remote but travel to Hebden Bridge and London for occasional workshops (such as co-design sessions with our members) will be necessary based on what work we're doing. Over the past year this has worked out to roughly once a month. Our other engineer, Matt, lives and works in Manchester. Bonus points if you live there as well!\n\nhours and salary\n\nYou’ll be working full-time for compensation up to £50,000, depending on experience. This role is also available part-time for the right candidate (minimum 3 days a week).\n\nbenefits\n\n30 days holiday per year. 4.5% pension contribution.\n\nequal care = equal opportunities\n\nEqual Care is an equal opportunity employer that is committed to diversity and inclusion in the workplace. We prohibit discrimination and harassment of any kind based on race, skin colour, sex, religion, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, disability, genetic information, pregnancy, or any other protected characteristic.\n\ndetails of the role\n\nMatt is our lead software engineer. You'll be joining him as the second engineer with a view to train and take over the daily operation of the Equal Care platform by the end of 2023, when Matt scales back to a few days per month.\n\nEqual Care takes a Sociocratic approach to organisation; our structure is formed of a distributed network of \"circles\" that have power over their particular domain. Our engineering approach is to build a toolbox that these circles can reach into and choose to take advantage of in order to organise their care and support needs.\n\nEach circle can be different to other circles in a wide range of ways. We observe and experiment with common themes that appear in order to nudge our circles towards building themselves up to be healthy and resilient. Software Engineers at Equal Care are responsible for the end-to-end process of turning those observations into experiments, and turning those experiments into well-crafted features.\n\nOver the first nine months, your job role will encompass these kinds of responsibilities:\n• Month 1\n• Meet the team, understand Equal Care's past, present and future, introduce yourself across the organisation and begin to craft relationships with people who enjoy engaging with the platform.\n• Take in the technical big picture and dive into some of the more crucial areas like our Neo4J Database, our permissions data model and our AWS infrastructure.\n• Squash some bugs to familiarise yourself with the main stack.\n• Months 2 - 4\n• Take over responsibility for a feature domain and shape its progression.\n• Get comfortable with designing, building, testing and monitoring new features.\n• Craft internal tools that engineers use to maintain the platform quickly and easily.\n• Months 5-9\n• Focus on longer term goals and patterns that we want to achieve. Advocate for and own the progress of reaching those goals.\n• Form a deeper understanding of where you want to take your role and the platform.\n• Work closely with Matt to define how the Equal Care engineering circle should progress from here.\n\npersonal qualities and values\n\nEqual Care is a very values-led organisation and we need you to feel strongly about our values as well. By taking on this role, you’ll be making important decisions that significantly affect the lives of all of our members. Holding ourselves accountable to the same set of values is crucial to making choices that resonate with our members' needs.\n\nThere is one value we ask everyone in our community to bring and to uphold: mutual care for one another. Complementing that core value, we aim to be hyper-accessible, open and transparent. We do not “move fast and break things” - in our world, “things” are people and their relationships to one another and they’re far too important to break.\n\nEqual Care is looking for a future leader, but the specifics of how this happens is down to where your personal goals overlap with organisational ones. We do, however, believe that there are some qualities that will be extremely important to have in order to lead successfully at this stage of our growth:\n• You must be a “manager of one”. Equal Care is full of great ideas but lacks enough time to do them all. A crucial part of your role is to own decisions about what to spend time on; it could be features for our booking system, our digital Medicine Administration Record, tools to help our workers find cover for their shifts or anything that becomes an immediate blocker to our growth or quality.\n• You must be privacy-conscious. We deal with sensitive information about people and we must treat that data with the respect and due care that it deserves.\n• You must be accessibility-conscious. This doesn’t mean lighthouse scores; this means real-world, messy interactions with our services. Many of our members will never use a computer directly but our services must be accessible to them in one form or another.\n• You must have experience and be comfortable with early-stage companies and the uncertainty inherent within them. We are still proving our model works at a larger scale. There will often be no clear answers to a question but you will be empowered to find them.\n\ntechnology\n\nThere are two must-haves:\n• Fluency with TypeScript\n• An understanding of Docker\n\nHere's a flavour of the technology you'll be working with. We're not looking for someone who knows everything; as long as you can learn quickly, you'll fit in perfectly:\n• Neo4J\n• Nest (TypeScript)\n• Next (TypeScript)\n• Rocket Chat\n• Keycloak\n• AWS Cloudformation based around ECS\n• Ansible (though we'd like to move away from this)\n\nEqual Care focuses on Healthcare.

We use predominantly C# written against the latest .NET stack, and favour microservices hosted on Azure using Kubernetes for all new implementations. We are constantly iterating towards a completely decoupled, event driven architecture across our entire software portfolio.\n\nThese are fully remote roles, within the following time zone (UTC -1 / UTC+3). Our engineers work remotely from locations such as UK, Europe and Africa... You will be reporting to the group Engineering Manager.\n\nWe have a mix of legacy services and greenfield microservices, so if you love the challenge of improving a legacy codebase while working on new projects, and if working remotely full time appeals, this might be a job for you.\n\nFlexible\n\nWe have flexible working hours in the afternoon, where our engineers decide to manage the time in the way they fit best, we support a well balanced work-life schedule where you can manage your own time to take breaks in the afternoon in the way that you see fit. We value the work being done and we believe we are all accountable professionals. We also have 5 days of learning and development per year, and plenty of opportunities to learn while doing the job.\n\nAre you looking for an opportunity to work in a company where progress, and humility are valued as highly as technical excellence?\n\nWhere we use the latest technologies and architectures to build fantastic customer experiences with a socially and environmentally conscious mission that echoes throughout the organisation.\n\nOur expectations are that you would be comfortable working as part of a team which owns the entire software stack, including the supporting infrastructure, throughout the entire software lifecycle from inception, through production and right the way to decommissioning under a DevOps culture. If you also value the constraints that continuous delivery places upon engineering processes and embrace testing and observability as first order concerns in the development of software, you probably have what it takes to join the team and shape our future.\n\nWhy M-KOPA?\n\nRecognized twice by the Financial Times as one Africa's fastest growing company (2022 and 2023) and by TIME100 Most influential companies in the world 2023 , we've served over 3 million customers, unlocking $1 billion in cumulative credit for the unbanked across Africa.\n\nAt M-KOPA, we empower our people to own their careers through diverse development programs, coaching partnerships, and on-the-job training.

We come from a diverse set of backgrounds and countries, enabling us to work at a global scale whilst bringing local impact by being a part of the communities we serve.

We are an agile team and follow a lightweight process strongly indexing on impact.

With the broadest and deepest applications of artificial intelligence (AI) for education, Turnitin is building innovative new products for the next decade of education that include AI writing detection and formative writing tools leveraging AI.\n\nTurnitin is a Remote-First company with work locations in Australia, Indonesia, Germany, Japan, South Korea, the Netherlands, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Our... diverse community of colleagues are all unified by a shared desire to make a difference in education. Come join us, and let's make change together.\nJob Description\n\nAs a Senior Front-end Software Engineer you'll be responsible for designing and implementing user interfaces that are visually appealing, user-friendly, and efficient. You'll collaborate with various stakeholders, lead UI development efforts, and ensure the quality and usability of the final product.\n\nResponsibilities:\n• User Interface Design: Collaborate with stakeholders, such as UX (User Experience) designers and product managers, to understand user requirements and translate them into visually appealing and intuitive interfaces. Create wireframes, mockups, and prototypes to demonstrate design concepts.\n• Front-End Development: Write clean, efficient, and maintainable code using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks (such as WebComponents, React, Angular, or Vue.js) to implement the user interface designs. Ensure cross-browser and cross-device compatibility and optimize application performance.\n• Responsive Design: Develop interfaces that adapt and function seamlessly across different screen sizes and devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. Implement responsive design principles to deliver a consistent user experience.\n• Interaction Design: Implement interactive elements and behaviours, such as animations, transitions, and micro-interactions, to enhance user engagement and improve usability. Utilise libraries and frameworks (e.g., CSS animations or JavaScript libraries) to create dynamic and interactive interfaces.\n• Collaboration: Work closely with UX designers, back-end developers, and other stakeholders to ensure alignment between the visual design and technical implementation. Participate in design reviews, provide feedback, and iterate on interface designs based on user feedback.\n• Performance Optimization: Identify and address performance bottlenecks in the user interface, such as slow rendering, excessive network requests, or inefficient code. Optimise images, utilise caching techniques, and implement code best practices to improve overall application performance.\n• Testing and Debugging: Conduct thorough testing of the user interface to identify and fix issues or bugs. Use debugging tools and techniques to troubleshoot and resolve front-end-related problems.\n• Documentation and Maintenance: Create documentation, style guides, and UI component libraries to ensure consistency and facilitate future development. Maintain and update existing UI components and interfaces as needed.\nQualifications\n• 5+ years professional software engineering experience with at least 4 years working with modern JavaScript frameworks developing scalable, performant commercial products\n• Be well-versed in best practices in writing efficient, understandable CSS and accessible, standards-compliant HTML\n• Understand front-end performance\n• Familiarity with current front-end build systems\n• Well-versed in writing and running unit- and integration tests\n• Accustomed to iterative development practices - breaking problems down, shipping small pieces rather than long-running features, etc.\n\nPreferred:\n• Performance optimization, accessibility and internationalization experience\n• Familiarity with WebComponents and/or StencilJS\n\nAdditional Information\n\nTotal Rewards @ Turnitin\n\nTurnitin maintains a Total Rewards package that is competitive within the local job market. People tend to think about their Total Rewards monetarily – solely as regular pay plus bonus or commission. This what they earn in exchange for what they do.

Our... diverse community of colleagues are all unified by a shared desire to make a difference in education. Come join us, and let's make change together.\nJob Description\n\nAs a Senior Front-end Software Engineer you'll be responsible for designing and implementing user interfaces that are visually appealing, user-friendly, and efficient. You'll collaborate with various stakeholders, lead UI development efforts, and ensure the quality and usability of the final product.\n\nResponsibilities:\n• User Interface Design: Collaborate with stakeholders, such as UX (User Experience) designers and product managers, to understand user requirements and translate them into visually appealing and intuitive interfaces. Create wireframes, mockups, and prototypes to demonstrate design concepts.\n• Front-End Development: Write clean, efficient, and maintainable code using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks (such as WebComponents, React, Angular, or Vue.js) to implement the user interface designs. Ensure cross-browser and cross-device compatibility and optimize application performance.\n• Responsive Design: Develop interfaces that adapt and function seamlessly across different screen sizes and devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. Implement responsive design principles to deliver a consistent user experience.\n• Interaction Design: Implement interactive elements and behaviours, such as animations, transitions, and micro-interactions, to enhance user engagement and improve usability. Utilise libraries and frameworks (e.g., CSS animations or JavaScript libraries) to create dynamic and interactive interfaces.\n• Collaboration: Work closely with UX designers, back-end developers, and other stakeholders to ensure alignment between the visual design and technical implementation. Participate in design reviews, provide feedback, and iterate on interface designs based on user feedback.\n• Performance Optimization: Identify and address performance bottlenecks in the user interface, such as slow rendering, excessive network requests, or inefficient code. Optimise images, utilise caching techniques, and implement code best practices to improve overall application performance.\n• Testing and Debugging: Conduct thorough testing of the user interface to identify and fix issues or bugs. Use debugging tools and techniques to troubleshoot and resolve front-end-related problems.\n• Documentation and Maintenance: Create documentation, style guides, and UI component libraries to ensure consistency and facilitate future development.

    "description": "About Zepz\n\nZepz is the group powering two leading global remittance brands: WorldRemit and Sendwave. Since 2010, we have been disrupting an industry previously dominated by offline legacy players with our relentless focus to reduce the cost of remittances and increase safety and convenience for our users. Every day, our people work to unlock the prosperity of cross-border communities through finance and technology - driven by our vision of a world that celebrates migrants' impact on prosperity, at home and abroad.\n\nOur brands helped cross-border communities send over $15bn from 50 countries to recipients in 130 countries in 2022. We operate over 5,000 money transfer corridors worldwide and employ over 1,400 people globally. Zepz is a remote-first employer, with team members located across six continents.\n\nOur vision is to create a world that celebrates migrants' impact on prosperity, at home and abroad. Our purpose is to unlock the prosperity of cross-border communities through... finance and technology.\n\nZepz.io\n\nOur Commitments:\n• We act like owners - We are relentlessly delivering for our users and spending money thoughtfully.\n• We embrace embarrassing honesty - We function best when we're open and honest with one another — especially about our challenges and doubts.\n• We have a bias to action - We get to first outcomes quickly, iterate and learn.\n• We strive to be better - We may make mistakes, but always learn from them.\n• We are inclusive - to better reflect and serve our users.\n\nWhat you will own:\n• Write great code: We understand code is read more than it's written, better off tested and maintainability is a must.\n• Help shape what we build: You'll be working closely with product owners, designers and other engineers to design and refine our work. We work as a team and your input is key.\n• Influence technology evolution: We are designing new platforms with long-term goals in mind and are also happy to improve with new technology capabilities\n• Own delivery: We're obsessed with shipping value; you'll own work beyond a pull request. You'll care about bugs, scalability, uptime and other non-functional requirements.\n• Grow together: You'll review others' work and happily seek feedback on yours to ensure we build a better codebase and sharpen each other's skills.\n• Share your knowledge and points of view: We promote knowledge sharing across our teams and count on you to become an active member of one. Experiment with new tools, present your findings, shape our future standards.\n• Scope and Impact: You invent and try to simplify what we do. You insist on the highest standards from your team and yourself. You have charisma. You lead or influence a team. You tackle open-ended somewhat ambiguous problems\n\nWhat you bring to the table:\n• Strong experience in building backend services/APIs. This role specifically is for an engineer with solid experience with Python backend services. A large part of the codebase you will be working on is currently in Python. We welcome generalists and polyglots.\n• We are in the process of breaking down a monolith application into smaller services and self contained data models. Therefore, experience working with microservices as well as monolith applications will come in handy. And if you have worked on a successful migration, even better.\n• Solid experience with system design and architecture\n• Experience with unit and integration tests\n• You are a system design enthusiast and have experience designing and transforming existing systems collaboratively to make them scalable, maintainable and reliable.\n• You have a true DevOps mindset and are able to support your team towards becoming true owners of their product/platform\n• You work well with Engineering and Product members and are comfortable building effective relationships with stakeholders outside technology.\n• An open mind with respect to diversity and inclusivity. Our team (and customers) come from all over the world.\n\nBonus Points if you:\n• Have worked at a scaling startup previously.\n• Have experience in successfully transitioning a monolith platform into domain-driven services.\n\nWhat we offer you:\n\nPlease note that the benefits below will apply to Full-time roles.\n\nWe have five core benefits for our talent in the US, UK, Philippines, Poland, and South Africa. If you're not in one of those regions, don't worry - the Talent team can let you know what is available for you specifically:\n• Unlimited Annual Leave: Most Zepz team members are eligible for unlimited annual leave. Colleagues in customer-facing roles, receive a competitive holiday allowance and four recharge days a year. Feel free to make the most of your time off and maintain a healthy work-life balance!\n• Private Medical Cover: You can opt-in to a Private Medical Insurance scheme. This provides you with access to thorough medical coverage, so you can feel confident in your health and well-being.\n• Retirement: We offer pension schemes to help you plan for and secure your future.\n• Life Assurance: Life assurance is available to give you peace of mind and protect your loved ones in case of the unexpected..\n• Parental Leave: We offer competitive parental leave schemes to ensure you are spending as much quality time with your new bundle of joy as possible.\n\nWe are also remote-first as an organisation, offering flexibility for you to work where you need to be most productive. In many locations, we have workspaces, which you can use as you desire.\n\nMost roles in the Philippines are predominately office-based, with this we offer free meals for those 100% on-site.\n\nIn addition to the above, you will discover that we have a range of secondary perks (such as the cycle-to-work scheme and employee discounts) depending on your location, to help you thrive at Zepz!\n\nWhy choose Zepz?\n• Our team of over 1400 employees is fully distributed across the world. We are working from coffee shops, homes, and co-working spaces — making us one of the larger fully distributed growth-stage startups in the world but we also offer workspace in our talent cluster locations - spaces we can meet, collaborate and connect.\n• We are proud parents, community organizers, farmers, band members, yoga teachers, YouTube influencers, former Olympians, and serial entrepreneurs.\n• We collectively speak over twenty languages, including Akuapem, Amharic, Bengali, Ewe, Fante, Ga, Igbo, Kalenjin, Luganda, Oromo, Somali, Swahili, Wolof, Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Irish, Italian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Maltese, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish and Swedish.\n• At Zepz, embodying our commitments binds us together. We are collectively passionate about striving to achieve our vision and purpose - to continue to provide the best service to our users.\n\nReady to apply?\n\nApplications will be reviewed on a rolling basis. If interested, please submit your resume along with a cover letter (optional), highlighting why your experience demonstrates you meet the requirements of the role. Please also indicate the countries in which you have work authorization. While Zepz supports visa sponsorship, sponsorship opportunities may be limited to certain roles and skills.\n\nAt Zepz we record interviews using Metaview (https://metaview.ai). It helps us become better interviewers by recording and transcribing our interviews, and ensures we interview candidates in a fair & consistent manner. It is not required. Please let us know if you'd like to opt out of the use of Metaview - this will not affect the outcome of your interview.\n\nConfidence can sometimes hold us back from applying for a job. But we'll let you in on a secret: there's no such thing as a 'perfect' candidate. Zepz is a place where everyone can thrive.\n\nSo however you identify and whatever background you bring with you, and if at all you might need any form of support to make the process as comfortable as possible, please let us know and give us a shot by applying.

    "description": "Research Software Engineer\n\nThe University of Manchester enjoys a global reputation for its research and its innovative approach to learning, with an on-going £1 billion investment in facilities, staff and buildings. This builds on our tradition of success that stretches back over 180 years. The birth of the modern computer, the splitting of the atom, the founding principles of modern economics, the discovery of graphene, and the birthplace of chemical engineering these and many more world changing innovations have their roots at our University. We are at the forefront of the search for solutions to some of the world's most pressing problems, boasting strong collaborative links with industry and public services.\n\nManchester has the largest student community in the UK, with more than 28000 undergraduates and 11000 postgraduates attracted by the high international standing of the academic staff, by the superb research and teaching facilities, and by the cultural assets both of the... university and the city of Manchester itself.\n\nFaculty of Science and Engineering\n\nThe Faculty of Science and Engineering is one of the largest in the UK with over 10,000 students, 2,000 staff and strategic links with over 300 industrial companies. We are leading research efforts in energy, nuclear science and technology, computer science, atmospheric science, bioscience and biotechnology, photon science and photonic materials, imaging and visualisation, security, and advanced materials, attracting an annual income of over £200 million.\n\nFounded in 1824, we have a history of breaking new ground in science and engineering. Rutherford began his work here on splitting the atom and later received the Nobel prize in 1908 for his work on radioactivity. The Baby, the worlds first stored-program computer, and Manchester Mark 1 came into being here. It is the birthplace of Chemical Engineering. The 76-m Lovell radio telescope at Jodrell Bank was built here by Bernard Lovell. Since 1906, when former student Joseph Thomson won the Nobel prize for physics, the University has produced more than 20 Nobel Laureates, the most recent of which were Professor Andre Geim and Professor Konstantin Novoselov in 2010 - for their pioneering work with the worlds thinnest material, graphene.\n\nDepartment of Physics and Astronomy\n\nThe Department of Physics and Astronomy is one of five Departments in the School of Natural Sciences which is in the Faculty of Science and Engineering. There are 95 academic staff in the Department with expertise in areas such as condensed matter physics (which includes Prof. Andre Geim and Prof. Konstantin Novoselov who won the 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics for their work on graphene), atomic physics, liquid crystal physics, biological physics, accelerator physics, nuclear physics, particle physics, astrophysics, astronomy, cosmology, complexity and theoretical physics. Jodrell Bank Observatory (part of Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics) also forms part of our Department. We have approximately 150 research staff, 250 PGR students and 1200 UG/PG students.\n\nThe Department has ranked in the top fifteen in the Academic Ranking of World Universities for Physics since 2011. In the Research Excellence Framework (REF) 2014 the Department was in the top three institutions for its proportion of world-leading components and was first for non-academic impact.\n\nThe Department values teaching highly and scored 90% in the 2019 National Student Survey. The Department has the largest undergraduate intake of any Physics department in the UK. Student cohorts are around 1120 and 100 for undergraduate and postgraduate taught programmes respectively. Taught postgraduate courses include Masters programmes in Photon Science, Nuclear Science and Technology, and Radio Imaging and Sensing.\n\nP&A research is based in four topical divisions: Accelerator, Nuclear and Particle Physics; Condensed Matter; Theoretical Physics; andJodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics. The Department operates the world-renowned Jodrell Bank Observatory (JBO). The Jodrell Bank site also provides the permanent home for the international headquarters of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) Organisation, and the UKs National Radio Astronomy Facility,e-MERLIN. The Department is deeply involved in the £61 million National Graphene Institute (NGI), opened in 2015. The NGI building has 7350 m2 research space over five floors and includes 1500m2 of cleanrooms, lab facilities, office space and seminar rooms.\n\nThe Department of Physics and Astronomy is committed to promoting Equality, Diversity, Inclusion and Access through contributing to the Universitys social responsibility agenda, demonstrating a commitment to its policies, activities and delivery of initiatives including the Athena SWAN charter for promoting womens careers in STEMM subjects (science, technology, engineering, mathematics and medicine) in higher education. The Department has held JUNO Champion status since 2016 for its commitment to achieving gender equality which positively promotes inclusivity for all.\n\nJodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics\n\nJodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics (JBCA) is one of the largest academic astronomy research groups in Europe, studying a very broad range of astrophysical research, in particular Cosmology, Galaxy formation and evolution, AGN and Star-formation, Galactic Astronomy, Time-domain astrophysics (including Pulsars, Masers and Exoplanets) and Solar Physics. Research staff are located in the Alan Turing Building on the main Manchester campus, and comprises around 30 academic staff, 50 postdoctoral researchers, and 60 post-graduate students. The Group publishes in excess of 400 refereed papers per year with many appearing in the highest impact journals. Academic staff are involved in many international collaborations with colleagues in Europe and North America but increasingly involves developing countries in Africa, Asia and South America. JBCA operates the 76-metre Lovell Telescope, and the UKs National Radio Astronomy Facility, e-MERLIN/VLBI, and hosts the UKs ALMA Regional Centre Node. JBCAs telescope facilities are located at Jodrell Bank Observatory, which also hosts the Headquarters of the SKAO. JBCA and SKA staff have close links, with several SKA staff enjoying honorary university appointments. Several large compute facilities are operated by the group both on campus and at the observatory.\n\nThe SKAO and SKA Regional Centres\n\nThe SKA will be the largest and therefore the most sensitive radio telescope ever built and will play a major role in answering key questions in modern astrophysics and cosmology (see ). It will be one of a small number of cornerstone observatories observing the electromagnetic spectrum that will transform our view of the Universe. The SKA Observatory (SKAO) comprises two telescope facilities; one located in South Africa, SKA-MID, to observe mid-band frequencies between 350MHz and 15.4GHz, and one located in Australia, SKA-LOW, to observe lower band frequencies between 50MHz and 350MHz. The SKAOs Global Headquarters, is hosted at The University of Manchesters Jodrell Bank Observatory.\n\nIn order to process and analyse the vast amounts of data produced by the SKAO, there is now an international effort to design and prototype SKA Regional Centres (SRCs) in which astronomers will be able to interact with the data. The network of SRCs will provide infrastructure, services and expert support that will enable a global capability to distribute, process, analyse and curate the data from the telescopes.\n\nThe UKs Square Kilometre Array Regional Centre project (UKSRC, 8 partners, £7.2M operations plus £6M capital and development 2023-2025), will work with an international network to develop infrastructure that will enable astronomers to transform our understanding of the universe, and provide the main interface for UK astronomers to access SKAO data and extract science from the SKAO. The UKSRC will provide e-infrastructure resources, services, and end-to-end expert science support and training to exploit the SKAO and SKA pathfinder and precursor data and science.\n\nTogether with colleagues at Cambridge, Durham, Edinburgh, RAL and UCL, The University of Manchester are co-developing a UKSRC facility. The UKSRC will be working within the SRCNet and contributing to the international SRCNet design programme. Areas of work include: data logistics; cloud computing; stewardship, archiving and data stack; science analysis platform; science support; training and outreach.\n\nThe University of Manchesters JBCA and Computer Science department form a major component of the new UKSRC facility. These advertised posts are part of a major recruitment process including 12 new appointments across research and technical development domains which will joining the existing team. The Manchester-UKSRC team will have the opportunity to be based across both the JBO in Cheshire, adjacent to the SKAO global Headquarters and JBCA in the University of Manchester central campus. UKSRC staff will be able to located at both sites providing a mixture of working environments embedded within a vibrant and stimulating research and operations groups. The Manchester-UKSRC will also work closely with e-MERLIN/VLBI National Radio Astronomy Facility, providing local access to SKA pathfinder data streams, the UKs ALMA Regional Centre Node, and JBCAs radio astronomy expertise, including world-leading groups working in Pulsar and time-domain astronomy, through to radio cosmology.\n\nThe UKSRC is a strategic priority for JBCA and STFC, and the SRCNet (and UKSRC) is being developed with the expectation of a multi-decade operational phase. Further extensions beyond this initial grant period are expected for successful candidates in these roles.\n\nAs an equal opportunities employer we welcome applicants from all sections of the community regardless of age, sex, gender (or gender identity), ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation and transgender status.

    "description": "Trainee Web Developer - No Experience RequiredAre you looking to kick-start a new career as a web developer?We are recruiting for companies who are looking to employ our Coding Traineeship graduates to keep up with their growth. The best part is you will not need any previous experience as full training will be provided. You will also have the reassurance of a job guarantee (21K-35K) upon completion. We are currently placing over 100 of our graduates into new roles each month.\n\nWhether you are working full time, part-time or unemployed, this package has the flexibility to be completed at a pace that suits you.The traineeship is completed in 4 easy steps.\n\nStep 1 - Introduction to Development - Complete a selection of professional and industry recognised coding courses covering HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and Python. The training is delivered via multimedia rich video tutorials, presentations and quizzes, through a portal that you study from home. These courses will give you the basic... understanding of the front end programming languages.\n\nStep 2 - Full-Stack Development - You will be studying a wide range of, mostly back-end programming languages and skills that will qualify you as a fully-fledged developer. Step 2 is heavily focused on the practical element of learning. With our courses, you will practice the skills as you learn them, through our inbuilt mini-project labs.\n\nStep 3 - Two real-world projects - Once you have completed your training you will be assigned 2 real-world projects by your tutor. The projects are the most important part of the Traineeship as it will showcase to employers your practical applications of the coding languages you learnt earlier in the Traineeship. The projects take on real-world scenarios for you to solve and will simulate similar projects that you will encounter when working as a future Developer.\n\nStep 4 - Portfolio Website - Now that you have completed the projects its time to showcase them on your own portfolio website. You will be creating a simplistic yet stylish website where you will be able to showcase to potential employers a snapshot of your level of ability as a Full-Stack developer. This will include the coding languages you are proficient in, links to the two real-world projects you completed, Github work you accumulated during your studies and any other relevant information.\n\nYour Web Developer Role\n\nOnce you have completed all of the mandatory training, which includes the online courses, practical projects and building your own portfolio, we will place you into a Web Development/Software Development role, where you will be guaranteed a starting salary of 21K-35K. We have partnered with a number of large organisations strategically located throughout the UK, providing a nationwide reach of jobs for our candidates.\n\nWe guarantee you will be offered a job upon completion, or we will refund you 100% of your course fees back.\n\nWe have a proven track record of placing 1000+ candidates into new roles each year. Check out our website for our latest success stories.\n\nRead through the information? Passionate about starting a career in IT? Apply now and one of our friendly advisors will be in touch.\n\nKeywords:Coding, programming, web developer, software developer, app developer, Trainee, PHP, HTML, SQL, CSS3, Java, Javascript, Python, C#, Trainee Web Developer",

The best part is you will not need any previous experience as full training will be provided. You will also have the reassurance of a job guarantee (21K-35K) upon completion. We are currently placing over 100 of our graduates into new roles each month.\n\nWhether you are working full time, part-time or unemployed, this package has the flexibility to be completed at a pace that suits you.The traineeship is completed in 4 easy steps.\n\nStep 1 - Introduction to Development - Complete a selection of professional and industry recognised coding courses covering HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and Python. The training is delivered via multimedia rich video tutorials, presentations and quizzes, through a portal that you study from home. These courses will give you the basic... understanding of the front end programming languages.\n\nStep 2 - Full-Stack Development - You will be studying a wide range of, mostly back-end programming languages and skills that will qualify you as a fully-fledged developer. Step 2 is heavily focused on the practical element of learning. With our courses, you will practice the skills as you learn them, through our inbuilt mini-project labs.\n\nStep 3 - Two real-world projects - Once you have completed your training you will be assigned 2 real-world projects by your tutor. The projects are the most important part of the Traineeship as it will showcase to employers your practical applications of the coding languages you learnt earlier in the Traineeship. The projects take on real-world scenarios for you to solve and will simulate similar projects that you will encounter when working as a future Developer.\n\nStep 4 - Portfolio Website - Now that you have completed the projects its time to showcase them on your own portfolio website. You will be creating a simplistic yet stylish website where you will be able to showcase to potential employers a snapshot of your level of ability as a Full-Stack developer. This will include the coding languages you are proficient in, links to the two real-world projects you completed, Github work you accumulated during your studies and any other relevant information.\n\nYour Web Developer Role\n\nOnce you have completed all of the mandatory training, which includes the online courses, practical projects and building your own portfolio, we will place you into a Web Development/Software Development role, where you will be guaranteed a starting salary of 21K-35K. We have partnered with a number of large organisations strategically located throughout the UK, providing a nationwide reach of jobs for our candidates.\n\nWe guarantee you will be offered a job upon completion, or we will refund you 100% of your course fees back.\n\nWe have a proven track record of placing 1000+ candidates into new roles each year.

The projects take on real-world scenarios for you to solve and will simulate similar projects that you will encounter when working as a future Developer.\n\nStep 4 - Portfolio Website - Now that you have completed the projects its time to showcase them on your own portfolio website. You will be creating a simplistic yet stylish website where you will be able to showcase to potential employers a snapshot of your level of ability as a Full-Stack developer.

          "Trainee Web Developer - No Experience Required Are you looking to kick-start a new career as a web developer?We are recruiting for companies who are looking to employ our Coding Traineeship graduates to keep up with their growth. The best part is you will not need any previous experience as full training will be provided. You will also have the reassurance of a job guarantee (£21K-£35K) upon completion. We are currently placing over 100 of our graduates into new roles each month.\n\nWhether you are working full time, part-time or unemployed, this package has the flexibility to be completed at a pace that suits you.The traineeship is completed in 4 easy steps.\n\nStep 1 - Introduction to Development - Complete a selection of professional and industry recognised coding courses covering HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and Python. The training is delivered via multimedia rich video tutorials, presentations and quizzes, through a portal that you study from home. These courses will give you the basic... understanding of the front end programming languages.\n\nStep 2 - Full-Stack Development - You will be studying a wide range of, mostly back-end programming languages and skills that will qualify you as a fully-fledged developer. Step 2 is heavily focused on the practical element of learning. With our courses, you will practice the skills as you learn them, through our inbuilt mini-project labs.\n\nStep 3 - Two real-world projects - Once you have completed your training you will be assigned 2 real-world projects by your tutor. The projects are the most important part of the Traineeship as it will showcase to employers your practical applications of the coding languages you learnt earlier in the Traineeship. The projects take on real-world scenarios for you to solve and will simulate similar projects that you will encounter when working as a future Developer.\n\nStep 4 - Portfolio Website - Now that you have completed the projects its time to showcase them on your own portfolio website. You will be creating a simplistic yet stylish website where you will be able to showcase to potential employers a snapshot of your level of ability as a Full-Stack developer. This will include the coding languages you are proficient in, links to the two real-world projects you completed, Github work you accumulated during your studies and any other relevant information.\n\nYour Web Developer Role\n\nOnce you have completed all of the mandatory training, which includes the online courses, practical projects and building your own portfolio, we will place you into a Web Development/Software Development role, where you will be guaranteed a starting salary of £21K-£35K. We have partnered with a number of large organisations strategically located throughout the UK, providing a nationwide reach of jobs for our candidates.\n\nWe guarantee you will be offered a job upon completion, or we will refund you 100% of your course fees back.\n\nWe have a proven track record of placing 1000+ candidates into new roles each year.

You'll be well used to taking UX designs and building them in to HTML5 web pages, incorporating them in to content management systems – and writing / editing the related back-end PHP code.\n\nDedicated to producing high-quality and elegant web solutions, you'll spend your time split between developing brand new sites and supporting existing client sites.\n\nYour Experience\n\nExperience designing and building websites using standards-compliant HTML5 and CSS, possibly pattern libraries, and SASS grid systems – ideally with a portfolio of impressive examples of live websites previously built or worked upon.\n\nExperience building websites in a digital agency is desirable but, if not in an agency environment, then in a role where the development of multiple websites is the primary part of your role.\n\nA demonstrable number of live websites that you... have built is essential – and you should include links to these within your application.\n\nSkills and Expertise\n• Competence with PHP and ideally the related MySQL\n• A working knowledge of modern HTML and CSS techniques – and ideally CSS pre-processors (e.g. LESS and SASS)\n• A working knowledge of JavaScript and JavaScript-related frameworks (e.g. JQuery, Knockout, Prototype and ES6)\n• Experience using WordPress CMS and Magento ecommerce CMS would be ideal\n• Magento is our primary development platform so experience with this would be extremely beneficial, though training opportunities will exist\n• Experience with any other content management systems would also be beneficial\n• An understanding of the technicalities of web server hosting – including Linux, Apache, RHEL and Nginx would be beneficial\n• Experience with version-control systems such as Subversion / Git / Bitbucket is desirable\n\nPersonal Characteristics\n\nA willingness to learn and develop technical skills is important – as is perseverance with problem-solving. A commitment to a high standard of work, attention to detail and perfectionism is also important. Our company ethos is one of striving to produce websites and systems that are better in every way – visually and functionally – than our competitors' – and this needs to carry through in all of the work carried out by our developers.\nCompany benefits Flexitime Cycle To Work Scheme Childcare Vouchers Social Events Pension Free Food Birthday Day Off Training Flexitime Flexible Working Hours\n\nStart early, finish early...

We are currently placing over 100 of our graduates into new roles each month.\n\nWhether you are working full time, part-time or unemployed, this package has the flexibility to be completed at a pace that suits you.The traineeship is completed in 4 easy steps.\n\nStep 1 - Introduction to Development - Complete a selection of professional and industry recognised coding courses covering HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and Python. The training is delivered via multimedia rich video tutorials, presentations and quizzes, through a portal that you study from home. These courses will give you the basic... understanding of the front end programming languages.\n\nStep 2 - Full-Stack Development - You will be studying a wide range of, mostly back-end programming languages and skills that will qualify you as a fully-fledged developer. Step 2 is heavily focused on the practical element of learning. With our courses, you will practice the skills as you learn them, through our inbuilt mini-project labs.\n\nStep 3 - Two real-world projects - Once you have completed your training you will be assigned 2 real-world projects by your tutor. The projects are the most important part of the Traineeship as it will showcase to employers your practical applications of the coding languages you learnt earlier in the Traineeship. The projects take on real-world scenarios for you to solve and will simulate similar projects that you will encounter when working as a future Developer.\n\nStep 4 - Portfolio Website - Now that you have completed the projects its time to showcase them on your own portfolio website. You will be creating a simplistic yet stylish website where you will be able to showcase to potential employers a snapshot of your level of ability as a Full-Stack developer. This will include the coding languages you are proficient in, links to the two real-world projects you completed, Github work you accumulated during your studies and any other relevant information.\n\nYour Web Developer Role\n\nOnce you have completed all of the mandatory training, which includes the online courses, practical projects and building your own portfolio, we will place you into a Web Development/Software Development role, where you will be guaranteed a starting salary of 21K-35K.

    "description": "Trainee Web Developer - No Experience RequiredAre you looking to kick-start a new career as a web developer?We are recruiting for companies who are looking to employ our Coding Traineeship graduates to keep up with their growth. The best part is you will not need any previous experience as full training will be provided. You will also have the reassurance of a job guarantee (£21K-£35K) upon completion. We are currently placing over 100 of our graduates into new roles each month.\n\nWhether you are working full time, part-time or unemployed, this package has the flexibility to be completed at a pace that suits you.The traineeship is completed in 4 easy steps.\n\nStep 1 - Introduction to Development - Complete a selection of professional and industry recognised coding courses covering HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and Python. The training is delivered via multimedia rich video tutorials, presentations and quizzes, through a portal that you study from home. These courses will give you the basic... understanding of the front end programming languages.\n\nStep 2 - Full-Stack Development - You will be studying a wide range of, mostly back-end programming languages and skills that will qualify you as a fully-fledged developer. Step 2 is heavily focused on the practical element of learning. With our courses, you will practice the skills as you learn them, through our inbuilt mini-project labs.\n\nStep 3 - Two real-world projects - Once you have completed your training you will be assigned 2 real-world projects by your tutor. The projects are the most important part of the Traineeship as it will showcase to employers your practical applications of the coding languages you learnt earlier in the Traineeship. The projects take on real-world scenarios for you to solve and will simulate similar projects that you will encounter when working as a future Developer.\n\nStep 4 - Portfolio Website - Now that you have completed the projects its time to showcase them on your own portfolio website. You will be creating a simplistic yet stylish website where you will be able to showcase to potential employers a snapshot of your level of ability as a Full-Stack developer. This will include the coding languages you are proficient in, links to the two real-world projects you completed, Github work you accumulated during your studies and any other relevant information.\n\nYour Web Developer Role\n\nOnce you have completed all of the mandatory training, which includes the online courses, practical projects and building your own portfolio, we will place you into a Web Development/Software Development role, where you will be guaranteed a starting salary of £21K-£35K. We have partnered with a number of large organisations strategically located throughout the UK, providing a nationwide reach of jobs for our candidates.\n\nWe guarantee you will be offered a job upon completion, or we will refund you 100% of your course fees back.\n\nWe have a proven track record of placing 1000+ candidates into new roles each year. Check out our website for our latest success stories.\n\nRead through the information? Passionate about starting a career in IT? Apply now and one of our friendly advisors will be in touch.\n\nKeywords:Coding, programming, web developer, software developer, app developer, Trainee, PHP, HTML, SQL, CSS3, Java, Javascript, Python, C#, Trainee Web Developer",

The best part is you will not need any previous experience as full training will be provided. You will also have the reassurance of a job guarantee (£21K-£35K) upon completion. We are currently placing over 100 of our graduates into new roles each month.\n\nWhether you are working full time, part-time or unemployed, this package has the flexibility to be completed at a pace that suits you.The traineeship is completed in 4 easy steps.\n\nStep 1 - Introduction to Development - Complete a selection of professional and industry recognised coding courses covering HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and Python. The training is delivered via multimedia rich video tutorials, presentations and quizzes, through a portal that you study from home. These courses will give you the basic... understanding of the front end programming languages.\n\nStep 2 - Full-Stack Development - You will be studying a wide range of, mostly back-end programming languages and skills that will qualify you as a fully-fledged developer. Step 2 is heavily focused on the practical element of learning. With our courses, you will practice the skills as you learn them, through our inbuilt mini-project labs.\n\nStep 3 - Two real-world projects - Once you have completed your training you will be assigned 2 real-world projects by your tutor. The projects are the most important part of the Traineeship as it will showcase to employers your practical applications of the coding languages you learnt earlier in the Traineeship. The projects take on real-world scenarios for you to solve and will simulate similar projects that you will encounter when working as a future Developer.\n\nStep 4 - Portfolio Website - Now that you have completed the projects its time to showcase them on your own portfolio website. You will be creating a simplistic yet stylish website where you will be able to showcase to potential employers a snapshot of your level of ability as a Full-Stack developer. This will include the coding languages you are proficient in, links to the two real-world projects you completed, Github work you accumulated during your studies and any other relevant information.\n\nYour Web Developer Role\n\nOnce you have completed all of the mandatory training, which includes the online courses, practical projects and building your own portfolio, we will place you into a Web Development/Software Development role, where you will be guaranteed a starting salary of £21K-£35K.
