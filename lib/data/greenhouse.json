    "description": "About Us:\n\nWe're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft...\n\nWe've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.\n\nNotion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).\nAbout The Role:\n\nMillions of people use Notion, and tens of thousands of developers are making Notion more powerful for those users (and themselves) by building features, power-ups, and novel new tools on top of Notion's developer interface.\n\nWe are focusing on extending our API for strategic partnerships and use cases. We need your help to make existing APIs more robust & reliable, while architecting new classes of APIs to cultivate a rich ecosystem of tooling built on top of Notion. You will design and build powerful, scalable, and developer-friendly sets of APIs, enabling partner and customer developers to extend Notion to be even more useful as a connected workspace for the millions of users and teams who rely on us every day.\nWhat You'll Achieve:\n• You'll help architect new classes of APIs that can be composed together by partner and customer developers to solve users' needs.\n• You'll understand the developer use cases and work to ensure that they are all well supported in the APIs you design and implement.\n• You'll improve the usability, performance, reliability and architecture of our externally facing developer APIs service and system.\nSkills You'll Need to Bring:\n• Experienced engineer & mentor: You have 8+ years of experience as a software engineer building scalable technology. You're excited about bringing your pre-existing knowledge and experience to the team. You have experience working with and mentoring other software engineers.\n• Pragmatic and business-oriented: You care about business impact and prioritize projects accordingly. You're not just going after cool stuff-you understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line.\n• External developer API expertise: You have experience building interfaces or tools for external developers to use, or you're motivated and excited to learn best practices in this domain.\n• Thoughtful problem-solving: For you, problem-solving starts with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You can decompose tricky problems and work towards a clean solution, by yourself or with teammates. You're comfortable asking for help when you get stuck.\n• Put users first: You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact-good and bad.\n• Empathetic communication: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed.\nNice to Haves:\n• You have experience working with public APIs either as a developer using, creating, or maintaining those APIs.\n• You have experience driving teams toward shared goals and can balance business priorities with individuals' strengths, areas of interest, and career development goals.\n• You're proficient with any part of our technology stack: React, TypeScript, Node.js, Memcached, Postgres and Docker.\n• You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others-and understand why we're big fans of their work.\n\nWe hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you're excited about a role but your past experience doesn't align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you're a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.\n\nNotion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer.
