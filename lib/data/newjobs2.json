    "description": "We are advancing AI to power the future of medicine.\n\nAt Unlearn, our purpose is to advance artificial intelligence (AI) to eliminate trial and error in medicine. We are developing generative machine learning methods to predict individual health outcomes and accelerate clinical innovation. Today, we are reimagining the randomized control trial (RCT) for the 21st century through AI-powered... clinical trials or TwinRCT. A TwinRCT allows more trial patients to receive the experimental treatment, reaches full enrollment faster and put patients first. Our innovative work in AI today will reinvent how AI is applied in medicine tomorrow — and we have a top secret plan for how to get there. We won’t be able to achieve this mission just by applying technologies created by others; the future must be invented.\n\nUnlearn is a technology company, not a biotech company. We use computers, not pipettes. We make and use software, we don’t discover or make drugs. We believe that AI will define the future of medicine, and we aren’t deterred by naysayers or skeptics.\n\nWe come from a variety of backgrounds ranging from machine learning to marketing—but regardless of where we come from, Unlearners share some common traits:\n\n>> Unlearners are ambitious; we aren’t intimidated by big, challenging goals.\n>> Unlearners are disciplined experimenters; we break down our big goals into smaller chunks and meet as often as necessary to track our velocity and iterate quickly.\n>> Unlearners are gritty; we never give up, setbacks just make us try harder.\n>> Unlearners are receptive to new ideas; in fact, we hate being stuck with the status quo.\n>> Unlearners are storytellers; sharing information with each other and with the world is super important, too important to be boring. And, last but not least,\n>> Unlearners are team-oriented; we put the mission first, the company second, the team third, and individuals last.\n\nFounded in 2017 by a team of world-class machine learning scientists, we have raised venture capital from top tier investors such as Insight Partners, Radical Ventures, 8VC, DCVC, and DCVC Bio. We completed our $50 million Series B in April 2022. We are headquartered in San Francisco, CA and have an additional office in Boston, MA.\n\nIf our purpose and culture resonate with you, we invite you to apply.\n\nUnlearn’s products provide AI-powered clinical trials that generate high-quality evidence in less time. A software engineer in our applied team is responsible for ensuring the software systems that support the delivery of our clinical applications are reliable and consistent. They need to develop and maintain robust tools and flexible pipelines that can adapt to the rapid development environment of our data and clinical methods. You will be part of an experienced team focused on identifying and solving challenging engineering problems.\nResponsibilities\n• Develop and maintain Unlearn’s proprietary software tools for clinical applications.\n• Design and develop reliable and scalable software systems in Python with extension to R and SAS.\n• Demonstrate software engineering best practices\n• Collaborate with multidisciplinary teams that include statistical programmers, - statisticians, scientists, and engineers\nRequirements\n• B.S. in computer science or related degree in a quantitative discipline\n• 3+ years in a related role\n• Fluency in Python\n• Experience developing GUIs for customers\n• Superior communication and collaboration skills\n• Track record of taking the initiative, demonstrating complete ownership, and delivering solutions to complex problems\n• Experience contributing to software libraries under active development\n• Experience designing and implementing cloud-based software systems (preferably AWS)\n• Able to work in either our San Francisco or Boston office at least 2 days a week\nBenefits & Perks\n\nWe offer a suite of benefits and perks for our team members, including:\n\n• Company-paid medical, dental, & vision insurance\n• 401k plan with generous company matching\n• Flexible time off and an annual winter break (December 24 - January 1)\n• Professional development budget to attend conferences or other events\n• One-time home-office set up stipend\n• Commuter benefits to help you get to our offices easily\n• Paid Parental Leave\n• Equity education and tax advisory services\n\nUnlearn is an equal opportunity employer.\n\nAt Unlearn, we are committed to building a diverse and inclusive workplace, because inclusion and diversity are essential to achieving our mission. If you’re excited about this role, and your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every qualification in the job description, we encourage you to apply nevertheless",

    "description": "Who We Are\n\nVerkada is the largest cloud-based B2B physical security platform company in the world. Only Verkada offers seven product lines — video security cameras, access control, environmental sensors, alarms, visitor management, mailroom management and intercoms — integrated with a single cloud-based software platform...\n\nDesigned with simplicity and scalability in mind, Verkada gives organizations the real-time insight to know what could impact the safety and comfort of people throughout their physical environment, while empowering them to take immediate action to minimize security risks, workplace frustrations and costly inefficiencies.\n\nFounded in 2016 with more than $360M in funding raised to date, Verkada has expanded rapidly with 14 offices across three continents, 1,500+ full-time employees and 15,700+ customers across 70+ countries, including 43 companies in the Fortune 500.\n\nOverview\n\nAs a member of our Systems Engineering team, you will lead, architect, and own the systems and processes that impact the Verkada sales, order, finance, and support teams. As our Salesforce org is still young, your decisions will have a massive impact, and you will have the chance to work with the latest Salesforce technology stack.\n\nResponsibilities\n• Your job is to write software that makes the company work well at scale. Make our systems work efficiently and reliably.\n• Decide when to build from scratch and when to use existing tools.\n• Work closely with the core software engineering team to integrate our product with our back end systems.\n• Learn new languages and frameworks quickly. We don’t expect you’ll have written Apex code, for example, but you should be able to pick it up quickly.\n• Example projects might include building components to visualize geographic data in Salesforce, or integrating and synchronizing our financial, sales, and fulfillment system databases.\n• You should be comfortable learning new systems and APIs quickly, e.g., Salesforce Apex, and be comfortable with basic web technologies like HTML, JavaScript, restful APIs, and so forth.\n\nRequirements\n• Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science or equivalent field, from a top program preferred.\n• 2+ years professional experience, with at least 2 years of software development or engineering experience.\n• Systems and software development experience: you need to be able to write production code efficiently. You are a hacker.\n• You like making people work better. If you’re the kind of person that gets satisfaction about building a tool that makes everyone’s life at work just a little better every day, you will love this job.\n• Design sensibility - we pride ourselves on building an intuitive product. We want our employees’ experience with their internal tools to be the same.\n• Process and operational thinking - you can tackle a problem independently and quickly iterate to a solution, and then also document it in a way that’s easy to understand for all audiences (especially non-technical ones!).\n• Project management and attention to detail: you’ll need to be able to scope out a project based on requirements outlined by an end user and figure out what it takes to translate an idea into reality.\n• Prior tech company or startup experience a plus.\n\n$90,000 - $180,000 a year\nEmployee Pay Disclosure\n\nAt Verkada, we want to attract and retain the best employees, and compensate them in a way that appropriately and fairly values their individual contribution to the company. With that in mind, we carefully consider a number of factors to determine the appropriate starting pay for an employee, including their primary work location and an assessment of a candidate’s skills and experience, as well as market demands and internal parity. For this role, Verkada estimates a starting annual base salary will fall in the range of approximately $90.000– 180,000. This estimate can vary based on the factors described above, so the actual starting annual base salary may be above or below this range. Annual base salary is also just one component of Verkada’s total rewards package. A Verkada employee may be eligible for additional forms of compensation, depending on their role, including sales incentives, discretionary bonuses, and/or equity in the company in the form of Restricted Stock Units (RSUs).\n\nUS Employee Benefits\n\nVerkada is committed to investing in the holistic health and wellbeing of all employees and their families. Our benefits and perks programs include, but are not limited to:\n\n• Healthcare programs that can be tailored to meet the personal health and financial well-being needs - Premiums are 100% covered for the employee under most plans and 80% for family premiums\n\n• Nationwide medical, vision and dental coverage\n\n• Health Saving Account (HSA) and Flexible Spending Account (FSA) with tax saving options\n\n• Expanded mental health support\n\n• Paid parental leave policy & fertility benefits\n\n• Time off to relax and recharge through our paid holidays, firmwide extended holidays, flexible PTO and personal sick time\n\n• Professional development stipend\n\n• Wellness/fitness benefits\n\n• Healthy lunches and dinners provided daily\n\nVerkada Is An Equal Opportunity Employer\n\nAs an equal opportunity employer, Verkada is committed to providing employment opportunities to all individuals. All applicants for positions at Verkada will be treated without regard to race, color, ethnicity, religion, sex, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, national origin, disability, age, marital status, veteran status, pregnancy, or any other basis prohibited by applicable law",

For this role, Verkada estimates a starting annual base salary will fall in the range of approximately $100,000 – 210,000. This estimate can vary based on the factors described above, so the actual starting annual base salary may be above or below this range. Annual base salary is also just one component of Verkada’s total rewards package. A Verkada employee may be eligible for additional forms of compensation, depending on their role, including sales incentives, discretionary bonuses, and/or equity in the company in the form of Restricted Stock Units (RSUs).\n\nVerkada is an equal opportunity employer.

    "description": "We are now looking for a Senior Framework Software Engineer for Autonomous Vehicles. Intelligent machines powered by Artificial Intelligence computers that can learn, reason and interact with people are no longer science fiction. Today, a self-driving car powered by AI can meander through a country road at night and find its way. An AI-powered robot can learn motor skills through trial and error... — this is truly an extraordinary time and the era of AI has begun. Our team builds the NVIDIA DriveWorks SDK with the goal to provide a scalable software stack and framework to build autonomous vehicles. We are seeking software engineers with interests on crafting, developing and maintaining the application framework and tools that we use to develop self driving solutions on multi computer and heterogeneous architectures. What you will be doing: Developing and optimizing software architecture and frameworks for real-world performance while matching or exceeding customer requirements. Working on areas such as component abstraction layers, inter-process data sharing and communication, and process scheduling. Developing efficient mechanisms to maximize utilization on computers with multiple heterogeneous hardware engines. Solidifying existing frameworks and software components and validate with large amounts of real and synthetic the improvements of the computational performance and system utilization. Performing in-vehicle tests, collecting data and completing autonomous drive missions. Developing unit tests, documentation for features, evaluating quality and proposing corrective actions. Developing highly efficient product code in C++, making use of high algorithmic parallelism offered by GPGPU programming (CUDA). Follow quality and safety standards such as defined by MISRA. What we need to see: 5+ years of relevant industry experience. BS/MS or higher or equivalent experience in computer engineering, computer science or related engineering disciplines. Excellent C and C++ programming skills. Experience developing and debugging multithreaded/distributed applications like multimedia systems, game engines, etc. Strong knowledge of programming and debugging techniques, especially for parallel and distributed architectures. Strong knowledge on Linux, Android, and/or other real-time operating systems. Experience with frameworks for robotics such as ROS and/or for multimedia such as GStreamer. Thrive on writing low latency, highly performant code Great communication and analytical skills. Self-motivated and a great teammate. Ways to stand out from the crowd: Understanding of embedded architectures. Experience on developing software in heterogeneous architectures, including GPUs. Knowledge of image processing APIs (e.g. OpenCV) and MATLAB tools. Knowledge of automotive systems, notably ADAS applications. Software development for modern OpenGL (Core Profile) and Linux. Experience with version control systems GIT and build system like CMake/Bazel. Be hands-on and work well within a team of algorithm, software and hardware engineers, with a significant level of detail orientation and a penchant for data organization and presentation. Image recognition and speech recognition — GPU Deep Learning has provided the foundation for machines to learn, perceive, reason and solve problems. The GPU started out as the engine for simulating human creativity, conjuring up the amazing virtual worlds of video games and Hollywood films. Now, NVIDIA's GPU runs Deep Learning algorithms, simulating human intelligence, and acts as the brain of computers, robots and self-driving cars that can perceive and understand the world. Just as human imagination and intelligence are linked, computer graphics and AI come together in our architecture. Two modes of the human brain, two modes of the GPU. This may explain why NVIDIA GPUs are used broadly for Deep Learning, and NVIDIA is increasingly known as “the AI computing company.” Make the choice to join us today! The base salary range is $144,000 - $270,250. Your base salary will be determined based on your location, experience, and the pay of employees in similar positions. You will also be eligible for equity and benefits. NVIDIA is committed to fostering a diverse work environment and proud to be an equal opportunity employer. As we highly value diversity in our current and future employees, we do not discriminate (including in our hiring and promotion practices) on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, gender expression, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, disability status or any other characteristic protected by law. #deeplearning NVIDIA is a Learning Machine NVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to tackle challenges no one else can solve. Our work in AI and the metaverse is transforming the world's largest industries and profoundly impacting society. Learn more about NVIDIA",

Compensation in other geographies may vary.\n\nActual compensation within the pay range will be decided based on factors including, but not limited to, skills, prior relevant experience, and specific work location. For roles that are available to be filled remotely, base salary is localized according to employee work location. Please discuss your intended work location with your recruiter for more information.\n\nDoorDash cares about you and your overall well-being, and that’s why we offer a comprehensive benefits package, for full-time employees, that includes healthcare benefits, a 401(k) plan including an employer match, short-term and long-term disability coverage, basic life insurance, wellbeing benefits, paid time off, paid parental leave, and several paid holidays, among others.\n\nIn addition to base salary, the compensation package for this role also includes opportunities for equity grants",
