Real People. Real impact.\n\nAt PropertyGuru Group, we believe that every person – no matter what their circumstance – should have a place to call home. That’s why we’ve been on a mission to transform how people find, finance, and own home across Southeast Asia over the last 13 years.\n\nVoted by property seekers as “Asia’s Most Influential Brand for Online Property Search”, PropertyGuru enables real-world aspirations through digital transformation and constant innovation. Every day, the work that we do has a real and positive impact on thousands of lives.\n\nPropertyGuru, Southeast Asia’s leading online property group, has embarked on a journey to fundamentally reshape how people in Southeast Asia finance their homes, launching PropertyGuru Finance in SG last year. The vision is to make home financing transparent and friction-free. As part of that vision, we aspire to become Singapore’s leading mortgage marketplace in the coming 3... years. We will pursue that aspiration through a buy-build strategy in which we will combine existing operations with targeted acquisitions, best-in-class partners, and in-house-built cutting-edge technology. We’re effectively driving a Fintech start-up within PropertyGuru Group.\n\nAs an employee, you’ll be empowered by our community work culture, where everyone has the autonomy, support, and resources to do the best work of their careers. As we evolve our journey to help people make confident property decisions, we stay true to our core values to guide the way we work and the decisions we make every step of the way: we own it and deliver it, we have fun and celebrate success, we respect and care for each other, we push beyond good, and we create what’s next.\n\nResponsibilities:\n\nAbout The Team\n\nWe help property seekers Find. Finance. Own their homes. We intend to accelerate the growth plans we have identified as more consumers move towards digital solutions for property buying and selling. Over the last fifteen years, we helped create the Proptech industry in this region, and as the market leader, we look forward to providing further innovations to digitize the property sector. We now aim to build end-to-end property management solutions and are investing toward venturing into Home Services.\n\nPropertyGuru has acquired “Sendhelper” which is a full stack digital platform that directly connects home service providers to consumers.
